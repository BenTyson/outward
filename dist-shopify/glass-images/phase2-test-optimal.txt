Phase 2 Test Image Instructions
================================

When you click "Preview (Phase 2 Test)" in the main app:
1. The image will be generated at 1600ร1200px
2. These dimensions are perfectly divisible by 80 strips
3. Download will be named: phase2-test-map-[timestamp].png
4. Copy this file to: public/glass-images/
5. Rename to: rocks-test-design-optimal.png

This will eliminate grid artifacts because:
- 1600 รท 80 = 20px per horizontal strip (no fractions)
- 1200 รท 80 = 15px per vertical strip (no fractions)
- No sub-pixel sampling issues
- Clean pixel boundaries align with strip boundaries
